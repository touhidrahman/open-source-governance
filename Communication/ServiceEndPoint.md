# Service End Point

Every governmental agency has to have a public service endpoint which will be reponsible for all kinds of public communication, queries, answering, services, liaison, internal coordination, appointments and similar.

No employee except the service point can be reached by public. 

There will be a paid option for high priority service.

The SEP will be available at the National Emergency Number + a code for direct navigation. *Example: 112, 112-3119*
