## What?
This is not a software. This project holds plain text files edited by smart contributors regarding how they would like to see their country run. Primarily focused towards Bangladesh but may be useful for other countries too.

## Why?
Because poltical governments fail to do things which is obvious to the general people.

## How?

### Guidelines
- Write true concepts and your ideas only.
- Only grammatial, spelling and linguistic mistake corrections will not be accepted. Don't contribute here if you are just planning to be that sort of contributor. 
- If you are taking help from other countries' system or deriving a concept from them, must include all the details to cross-check. Also discuss why do you think this will work against the prevailing problems.
- Creation of new Sections (Folders) and Sub-sections (Files) will only be accepted if you have identified problems and listed correctly. Otherwise look for existing folders and files.
