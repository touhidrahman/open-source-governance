# New Method

Teacher will assign a student to prepare himself as a teacher for a class. The contents that would be taught by him will be defined by the teacher. He will have reasonable time for preparing class material and himself. He can consult with the teacher during the teacher's office time for his preparation and understanding. 

On the day of class, he is expected to teach the given contents to other fellow students. The teacher will observe and add missed things, more clarifications, examples to the acting teacher.

The student will be evaluated on his understanding, delivery, and so on.

This model might be effective in order to eliminate exams.
